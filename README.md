## Module Training Phase

The course consists of 3 distinct phases:

* Basics - introducing the foundations of software development and studying HTML and CSS
* Orientation - learning the core concepts in programming (that can translate to other languages), and then expanding deeper into the facilities and opportunities afforded in the Javascript environment.
* Project - We form working groups that are working independently with mentor supervision on a lifelike project.
